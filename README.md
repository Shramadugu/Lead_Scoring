# Lead_Scoring_Case_Study 
## Project Overview

This case study involves analyzing a leads dataset with around 9,000 data points to predict lead conversion outcomes. The target variable, 'Converted', indicates whether a lead was successfully converted (1) or not (0).

The main objective is to build a logistic regression model that assigns a lead score (0â€“100) to prioritize leads based on their likelihood of conversion. High scores represent "hot" leads with high conversion potential, while low scores indicate "cold" leads.

Additionally, the project addresses specific business problems outlined in a separate document. The model and recommendations must be adaptable to future changes in business requirements.

The deliverables include:

* A well-documented logistic regression model.
* Solutions to business-specific problems.
* A concise presentation highlighting findings and actionable insights.
* A summary report outlining the approach, results, and learnings.
  
This analysis helps the company optimize its lead conversion process by identifying and prioritizing high-potential leads.
